    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we have to merge the two DataFrames formed in tasks 1 and 2 into a single one, using the universities names to be able to match them accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, we decided to see which names from one website look like which ones from the other website. One pretty good way to compute how much a string \"looks like\" another one is to use the Levenshtein distance. The Levenshtein distance gives the number of edits we should do in order to get from one string to the other. For example, the Levenshtein distance of \"I like data analysis\" and \"I love data science\" is 10 because we only have to edit 2 characters to go from \"like\" to \"love\", and then we have to completely rewrite \"analysis\" into \"science\" (7 characters) because nothing is common, and in the end we have to remove the last character of \"analysis\" because \"science\" contains 1 character less than \"analysis\"; so 2 + 7 + 1 = 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the distance between two strings, we can infer a number from 0 to 1 representing how much both strings are similar, 0 being \"not similar at all\" and 1 being \"the same\". We just have to take the maximum length of both string and divide it by the distance between both strings, and then we subtract it from 1. This will be our heuristic to evaluate how likely are two universities (from different websites) to match, using their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have something to measure the likelihood of two universities (from different websites) to match, we can iterate over all the ones from the first website and for each one of them, we find the most similar university from the second website (always taking the top 200 only). We can do the same but vice-versa: for each university from the second website, we find the most similar one in the first website. Once we have that, we can compare that both ways of matching \"agree\" with each other. For example, if 'uniA' from the second website is the most similar one to 'uniZ' from the first website, then it should be the case that 'uniZ' is the most similar one to 'uniA'. If this is indeed the case, we store it as a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare two universities names, we've remove all leading 'The ', all ',' and all parentheses (with their content) to compare them fairly. One other thing we also did here is putting a threschold that forces the similarity to be bigger than the threshold in order to be considerer a match. We played a bit with this threshold manually in order to keep only the real match together (we looked at the matchings trying out different thresholds and took a threshold that was allowing to match everything correctly); we've set the threshold to 0.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this technique, the universities that does not appear on both lists will be filtered out (which is what we should do from what we've read on the FAQ), so that's perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, we just have to concatenate the information from the matching universities. We've also added a column ('matching_confidence') representing how confident we were about this match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't really have assumptions for this task. We are just using a heuristic to compute the similarity between two universities based on their names, and we are also using a similarity threshold (with value found manually, after inspection of results with different other thresholds) that allows us to match all the universities that we can."
