    "[TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf), short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is of great help when if comes to compute textual features. Indeed, it gives more importance to terms that are more specific to the considered articles (TF) but reduces the importance of terms that are very frequent in the entire corpus (IDF). Compute TF-IDF features for every article using [TfidfVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html). Then, split your dataset into a training, a testing and a validation set (10% for validation and 10% for testing). Each observation should be paired with its corresponding label (the article category).\n",

Try to fine-tune the parameters of your predictor on your validation set using a simple grid search on the number of estimator \"n_estimators\" and the max depth of the trees \"max_depth\". Then, display a confusion matrix of your classification pipeline. Lastly, once you assessed your model, inspect the `feature_importances_` attribute of your random forest and discuss the obtained results."

    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a Random Forest to classify the news articles, we start by downloading all the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use the `TfidfVectorizer` to turn the data into vectors in order to be able to insert it in our random forest.\n",

    "\n",
    "After that, we use grid search and cross-validation to fine tune our model and select the best parameters for max_depth and n_estimators (which is the depth of the trees and the number of trees in the random forest, respectivel)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when we obtain a good-enough accuracy in our validation phase, we assess the model and test the accuracy on the test set. We also plot a confusion matrix where we can see the accuracy for each category\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "We assumed that the training data was well balanced (and verified that it was) before creating the test and training sets. It the data was not balanced, we could have used a weighted or stratified sampling."
