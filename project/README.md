# Is adopting a healthier lifestyle a long-term social change?

# Abstract
##### Definition of "healthy lifestyle"
> *"A healthy lifestyle, excluding any damaging influences, defines the positive and voluntary measures a person can implement to maintain good mental and physical health. This includes healthy habits in terms of diet, treatment of the body, sex, and the environment"*, http://health.ccm.net 

The idea of the project is to asses whether the population of western countries are adopting a healthier lifestyle. This project aims to determine if this adoption is a trend or a long-term social change. In either cases, we will try to predict the evolution of this behavior over the upcoming years.

In order to achieve that goal, we will use the Amazon reviews dataset. From those reviews, we can extract information about consumer satisfaction, dates, product categories and the enthousiasm for certain products.

With the emergence of new institutions promoting healthy lives (like vegan shops or fitness centers), finding insights and patterns in people's behavior could be useful to define in which direction this social change is heading.

# Research questions
* Study the evolution of the enthousiasm for healthy products over time.
* Study the correlation between amazon reviews and trends (using Google Trends).
* Determine of the "hype" factor of healthy product categories.
* Forecast the "hype" factor over the upcoming years by categories in order to predict new trends or define decaying ones.
